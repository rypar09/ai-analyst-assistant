Apple Inc. is a leading technology company known for its innovative products in smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and wearables. The company also offers a range of services such as advertising, AppleCare, cloud services, and digital content. Apple operates in a highly competitive industry facing challenges from rivals with significant resources and broad product lines. Key competitive factors include pricing, product quality, innovation, and marketing strategies.

In 2024, Apple demonstrated growth in net sales across its geographical segments, mainly driven by increased sales in Services. The company's gross margin percentage improved due to cost savings, while research and development expenses increased primarily from headcount-related costs. However, a higher effective tax rate in 2024, linked to a one-time income tax charge, impacted profitability. Apple's commitment to innovation and expanding its product and service offerings remains crucial to its long-term success amidst competitive pressures.

Risks for Apple include global economic conditions, international disputes, and supply chain disruptions. Moreover, the need for continuous innovation and evolving industry standards pose challenges. Legal proceedings and uncertainties in tax positions also present potential risks. Apple's emphasis on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace enhances its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standing. Analysts note the importance of Apple's ability to introduce new products successfully and navigate the competitive landscape for sustained growth.
